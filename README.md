# AI-Human Generated Classifier

### By Itamar Kraitman & Haim Goldfisher

## Introduction
This project is aimed at developing an AI-powered classifier capable of distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated text.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/haimgoldfisher/Ai-Human-Generated.git
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application
To run the main application, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

After running the program, you will be prompted to enter text. Please enter your text when prompted and press Enter to classify whether the text was written by a human or AI.
